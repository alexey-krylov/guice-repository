==Developer Guide==
Welcome to the developer documentation of guice-repository project - a Google Guice adapted version of [http://static.springsource.org/spring-data/data-jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#preface Spring Data-JPA] project with some additional features.

Current project version is: *1.0.0*

==What are Spring Data-JPA?==
Here is description from Spring Data-JPA authors:

"_Spring JPA is part of the umbrella Spring Data project that makes it easy to easily implement JPA based repositories._"

For my opinion it is very useful project that helps developer to work hard on business logic and avoid writing boilerplate code around persistence layer.

==What are guice-repository?==
Guice-repository is a bridge between _Spring Data-JPA_ and _[http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/wiki/GuicePersist Guice-Persist]_ with additional features:
 * Support for [http://www.objectdb.com/java/jpa/persistence/store#Batch_Store_ batch store] (see [BatchStore this] page)
 * Allow access to EntityManager from Repository (see EntityManagerProvider)
 * Repository Auto-bind possibilities - no need to do manual .bind() for each Repository (see [AutoBind])

==How did this work?==

There is a three main steps:

1. Define a [http://static.springsource.org/spring-data/data-jpa/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/jpa/repository/JpaRepository.html Repository] interface

{{{
public interface AccountRepository extends JpaRepository<Account, Long>,
        EntityManagerProvider {

    Account findAccountByUuid(String uuid);

    @Query("select a from Account a where a.name = :name")
    Account findAccountByName(@Param("name") String name);
}
}}}

This process is well described in the [http://static.springsource.org/spring-data/data-jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.definition original manual].
All features described in 1.1-1.4 documentation parts is supported by _guice-repository_.

2. Install a Guice-module

You can select between manual Repository binding in JpaRepositoryModule and auto-binding with ScanningJpaRepositoryModule.

Example for JpaRepositoryModule:
{{{
install(new JpaRepositoryModule("my-persistence-unit") {
            protected void configureRepositories() {
                bind(AccountRepository.class).toProvider(new JpaRepositoryProvider<AccountRepository>());
            }
        });
}}}


JpaRepositoryProvider is a main "magic-maker" - it searches for Repository implementations, creates a Spring context, initialize all needed underlying Beans & Factories and so on. It should be always parametrized with your Repository class - this is a starting point for implementation resolving.

Example for [AutoBind ScanningJpaRepositoryModule]:
{{{
install(new ScanningJpaRepositoryModule("com.mycorp.repo", "my-persistence-unit"));
}}}

In this case "com.mycorp.repo" is a package where your Repository interfaces is located.

3. @Inject & use

Inject and use Repository in your services/business-logic modules:

{{{
public class AccountService {
   
    @Inject
    private AccountRepository accountRepository;

    public void registerUser(String login, String password) throws RegistrationException{
     // ... some checks & etc
     accountRepository.save(new Account(login, password));
     // ... something else
    }

    public Account findAccount(String login) throws FinderException{
     return accountRepository.findAccountByLogin(login);
    }
}
}}}

==Why not just use pure Guice-Persist?==

My own best-reasons-list for this is:
 * Reduce boilerplate code around persistence layer
 * Simplify understanding of Domain model and its lifecycle aspects between team members
 * Isolation from ORM-configuration vendor specifics (see [ImplementationSpecifics this] page) in EntityManager configuration
 * OOM-protected Batch-insert feature

==Where i can get it?==

Project is mavenized and published in Central Maven repository.

{{{
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.code.guice-repository</groupId>
    <artifactId>guice-repository</artifactId>
    <version>${version.guice-repository}</version>
</dependency>
}}}

This project is depends on many other 3rd party libraries which is required to work. So, _without_ Maven you should manually add actual versions of this 3rd party libraries. Actual list of them can be viewed in _dependencies_ section of [http://code.google.com/p/guice-repository/source/browse/trunk/pom.xml pom.xml].

Actual project version will be always on top of this page.
