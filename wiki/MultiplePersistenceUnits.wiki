Since 2.0.0 it's possible to work with multiple persistence units.

This process is quite simple:
 #. Define persistence units and entities in META-INF/persistence.xml;
 #. Define names of persistence units in JpaRepositoryModule/ScanningJpaRepositoryModule constructor;
 # . Define persistence unit name during repository binding process with RepositoryBinder or with annotating Repository interface with @Transactional(value="persistence-unit-name") or with @PersistenceContext(unitName="persistence-unit-name");
 #. Mark method, which operates with Repository, with @Transactional(value="persistence-unit-name")

This process based on Spring Data JPA default way for multiple persistence units resolution, you can see related docs/examples here:
